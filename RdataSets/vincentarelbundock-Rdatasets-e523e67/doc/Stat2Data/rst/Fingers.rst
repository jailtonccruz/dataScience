Scientists Scott and Chen, published research that compared the effects
of caffeine with those of theobromine (a similar chemical found in
chocolate) and with those of a placebo. Their experiment used four human
subjects, and took place over several days. Each day each subject
swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine, theobromine, or the
placebo. Two hours later they were timed while tapping a finger in a
specified manner (that they had practiced earlier, to control for
learning effects). The response is the number of taps in a fixed time
interval.

Renamed FranticFingers in second edition.
