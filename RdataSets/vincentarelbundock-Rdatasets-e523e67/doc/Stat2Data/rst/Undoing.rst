Details
~~~~~~~

A patient had been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive/compulsive disorder)
and underwent a series of psychotherapy sessions. Notes from the
sessions were presented to three different experienced therapists who
rated sessions with a particular OCD symptom (defense of undoing) on a 1
to 4 scale (smaller values indicating worse symptoms). If all three
judges agreed on the stage of a session, that determined the category.
Otherwise, they discussed until they reached a consensus. The sessions
were also grouped into six groups with I being the earliest sessions and
VI being the latest.
