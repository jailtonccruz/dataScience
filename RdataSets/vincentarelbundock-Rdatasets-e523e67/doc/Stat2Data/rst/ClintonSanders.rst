In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination for U.S. President
over Bernie Sanders. A paper was circulated that claimed to show
evidence of election fraud based, among other things, on Clinton doing
better in states that don't have a paper trail for votes cast in a
primary election than she did in states that have a paper trail. Data is
for the 31 states that held Democratic primaries in 2016.
