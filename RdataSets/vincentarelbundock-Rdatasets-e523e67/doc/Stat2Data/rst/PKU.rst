Dopamine levels with PKU in diets
---------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Dopamine levels with different amounts of phenylalanine in diets

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.

``Subject``
   Initials to identify each subject

``Diet``
   Level of phenylalanine in diet (``Low`` or ``Normal``)

``DietControl``
   Ability to follow prescribed diet (``Good`` or ``Poor``)

``Y``
   Concentration of dopamine (micrograms per milligram of creatinine)

Details
~~~~~~~

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an enzyme deficiency that keeps a person from
being able to synthesize enough dopamine. The amino acid phenylalanine
inhibits the enzyme needed to synthesize dopamine, and so to some
extent, a diet low in phenylalanine can moderate the symptoms of PKU. In
short, less phenylalanine in the diet should lead to more dopamine in
the brain. The dopamine level for each patient was measured after a
normal diet and after a week on a low phenylalanine diet.

Several of the values were altered slightly in ways that would not
change the analysis except to simplify the arithmetic.
