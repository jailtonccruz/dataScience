Details
~~~~~~~

In 1999 Grinnell College students Laurelin Muir and Adam Gratch
conducted an experiment for an introductory statistics class. They
intentionally "lost" 140 letters in either the city of Des Moines, the
town of Grinnell, or on the Grinnell College campus. Half of each sample
were addressed to Friends of the Confederacy and the other half to Iowa
Peaceworks. The students kept track of which letters were eventually
returned.
