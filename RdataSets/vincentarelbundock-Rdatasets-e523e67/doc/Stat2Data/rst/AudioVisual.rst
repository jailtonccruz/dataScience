Reaction Times to Audio and Visual Stimuli
------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from an experiment on reaction times to audio or visual stimuli by
Oberlin College students.

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 72 observations on the following 4 variables.

``Subject``
   SubjectIDs coded ``s1`` to ``s36``

``ResponseTime``
   Time to respond to a stimulus (in ms)

``Stimulus``
   Type of stimulus (``auditory`` or ``visual``)

``Group``
   ``Musician`` or ``NonMusician``

Details
~~~~~~~

Subjects in a reaction time study were asked to press a button as fast
as possible after being exposed to either an auditory stimulus (a burst
of white noise) or a visual stimulus (a circle flashing on a computer
screen). Average reaction times (ms) were recorded for between 10 and 20
trials for each type of stimulus for each subject. Data also identifies
which subjects are musicians.
