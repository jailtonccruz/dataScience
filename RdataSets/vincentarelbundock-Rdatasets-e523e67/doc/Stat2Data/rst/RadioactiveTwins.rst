Comparing Twins Ability to Clear Radioactive Particles
------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Experiment comparing twins (one urban, one rural) ability to clear
airborne radioactive particles from their lungs

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 30 observations on the following 3 variables.

``TwinPair``
   Identifies the twin pairs (1 to 15)

``Env``
   Residential environment (``Rural`` or ``Urban``)

``Rate``
   Clearance rate (percentage radioactive particles remaining after one
   hour)

Details
~~~~~~~

To assess lung health, the scientists measured "tracheobronchial
clearance rate," that is, in English, "How fast do your lungs get rid of
nasty stuff?" Each subject agreed to inhale an aerosol of radioactive
Teflon particles. A Geiger counter held to the chest measured the
radioactivity just after inhaling, and again one hour later. The
clearance rate was the percentage of radioactivity remaining â€“ the lower
the better. Subjects were 15 sets of identical twins, each pair with one
twin living in an urban environment and the other in a rural
environment.
