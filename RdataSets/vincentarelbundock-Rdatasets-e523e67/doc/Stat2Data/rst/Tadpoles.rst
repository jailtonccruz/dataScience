Effects of a Fungus on Tadpoles
-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparing intestine lengths for tadpoles with and without exposure to Bd
fugus

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 27 observations on the following 4 variables.

``Treatment``
   Exposed to fungus (``Bd``\ =yes or ``Control``\ =no)

``Body``
   Length of body (in mm)

``GutLength``
   Length of intestine (in mm)

``MouthpartDamage``
   Measure of damage to the mouth (e.g. missing teeth)

Details
~~~~~~~

Biologists wondered whether tadpoles can adjust the relative length of
their intestines if they are exposed to a fungus called Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis (Bd).
